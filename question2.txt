2. When choosing a Plugin for a WordPress requirement, 
how do you evaluate and choose when there is more than one option?


* I look at the Wordpress plugin directory and pick the one with the most reviews and stars and free vs paid. 
I tend to avoid plugins with fewer than 1k reviews and a lot of negative reviews. 

* I then go to plugin website and look at the documentation and changelog to see how often the developer maintains it.
I tend to avoid plugins that was last updated more than 2 years ago. Moreover, The changelog comments can give you a brief overview of the quality of the code.
An optional action I would sometimes do for plugins is to contact the developer and check the response time beforehand. 
For example, when I built an image gallery for Kanataseniors.ca, I picked the WP Carousel plugin because the quick response time from the developer.

* I then test the plugin on a sandbox wordpress site to check the general usability of a plugin and 
look at the database to see if there are any extra tables created. That would be beneficial in the future
when you are working with large websites or multisites as hundreds of plugins will add a lot of database bloat
which can reduce website speed.

* I then install the plugin in the local wordpress development for the client to check if it compatible with other
installed plugins. It has happened that a newly installed plugin broke other plugins, especially with large multisites.

* I also check for the performance of the plugin and check by how much it slows the websites using tools
like google page speed and query monitor. I then compare the before and after values.
