3. Given the following JavaScript code, what is the value of arr[2]?
var arr = [];
arr.push('a');
arr.push('b');
arr.push('c');

answer:
c

// When you push a into the array, a is stored in index 0, b in index 1 and c in index 2. When you return arr[2],
// it retrieves the data from index 2 which is c.
